To run the code:
    -> consult('game.pl').
    -> play.


--- AI ---
value(+GameSTate, +Player, -Value)
    => Receives the current game state
    => Returns a value measuring how good/bad the current game state is to the given Player 

choose_move(+GameState, +Level, -Move)
    => Recives the current game state
    => Returns the move chosen by the computer player
        - Level 1 = Return a random valid move
        - Level 2 = Return best play at the time (Greedy Algorithm) considering the evaluation of the game state as determined by the value/3 predicate
        - For human players it should interact with the user to read the move

-> You cannot use assert or retract to store / manipulate game configuration or game state information. If you need information from the game configuration, 
you can include it in the game state term

-> Source code should follow established conventions for code quality and organization. Use meaningful names for predicates and arguments. 
-> Try to write code that looks declarative and avoid using imperative-looking constructions (e.g., if-then-else clauses). 
-> Try to write efficient code (e.g., using tail recursion when possible)

-> All source code must be properly commented. Each of the predicates listed above should have extended comments describing the strategy used to implement it


VLKNO GAME RULES:

VLKNO is a 2 player abstract strategy game played on a 5x5 grid covered in 25 stackable stones.

Players each have 2 pawns in their color, which are placed on stones in diagonally opposite corners of the grid at the start of the game.

Each turn, you do the following actions:

    Move either of your pawns one space in any direction to a stack of 1+ stones that's the same height, or 1 stone taller, or 1 stone shorter than yours.
    Pick up a stone from the smallest unoccupied stack on the board, except the one you just came from (if there's a tie for shortest stack, you choose which one).
    Place it on any unoccupied stack of 1+ stones except the one you just came from.

You win when your opponent cannot complete each step of their turn.
